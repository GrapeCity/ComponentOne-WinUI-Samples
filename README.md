# ComponentOne WinUI Edition Samples 

Add enterprise features to your new desktop applications based on the latest WinUI 3.0 framework.

This repository contains the samples for [ComponentOne WinUI Edition](https://developer.mescius.com/componentone/winui-controls). These samples provide complete implementation details for the UI control features. They are also included with the full download and install from developer.mescius.com/componentone. 

The samples reference, but do not include, the control packages. The control packages can be downloaded from nuget.org.

## Building a Sample 

WinUI samples require Windows 10, version 1809 (build 17763) and Visual Studio 2019 and above. They also require the Universal Windows Platform development workload and the Windows App SDK (Project Reunion) extension. Then run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample: 

```
dotnet build 
dotnet run 
```

This will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run the project respectively.
